# Server for YOUNITE Website

This express.js server serves axios requests from the react.js frontend section. It provides data related to the respective events, fest etc.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YouniteSRHU/website.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd website/server
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server when you make changes.
